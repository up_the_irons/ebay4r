RELEASE NOTES
-------------

v1.1:

  * Upgraded to eBay API 555

v1.0:

  * Upgraded to eBay API 529

  **IMPORTANT** 
  
  For all but the simplest of calls to eBay's API, you will need to make
  changes to your code if you are upgrading from previous versions of eBay4R.

  There were some subtle, but very important, changes.  The version of SOAP4R
  needed to use eBay's newer API versions changes the way we interact with
  certain data types.  

  * AmountType fields must be strings, implicit conversion from float no longer
    occurs in SOAP4R 1.5.7+.  For example, previously you could have::

      :StartPrice => 12.0

    but now it must be::

      :StartPrice => '12.0'

  * Dependency SOAP4R 1.5.7+ has better support for arrays.  Notice how the 
    test/tc_routing.rb test had to be changed::

      -    assert_equal(resp.categoryArray.category.categoryName, "eBay Motors")
      +    assert_equal(resp.categoryArray[0].categoryName, "eBay Motors")

    When single element arrays are returned in the SOAP response, you now 
    access them with the familiar Ruby array index, instead of following the
    XML tree and putting "." in between each node.

    Another example of before/after (from examples/add_item.rb):

    Old::

      resp.fees.fee.each do |fee|

    New::

      resp.fees.each do |fee|

  * Short-hand way of creating complex data types no longer works.  I think
    older SOAP4R's gave me this for free, but upon looking at the XML dump a
    second time, it doesn't create the objects correctly.  Not sure if eBay's
    API in the 4xx range silently ignored these bad values.  If anyone can get
    this working again, send me a patch.

    Old::

      resp = eBay.AddItem(:Item => { :PrimaryCategory => { :CategoryID => 57882 },
                                     ...
                                     ...
                                     })

    New::

      resp = eBay.AddItem(:Item => EBay.Item(:PrimaryCategory => EBay.Category(:CategoryID => 57882),
                                             ...
                                             ...
                                             })

  * SetNotificationPreferences suffers the most (of the examples) from the
    above changes.  See examples/set_notification_preferences.rb to see how
    it's done now.
